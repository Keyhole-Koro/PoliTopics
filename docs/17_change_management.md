# 17. Change Management
[日本語版](./jp/17_change_management.md)

## Spec changes
- No documented change control process (TBD).
- Suggested: update docs in `docs/` alongside code changes.

## Versioning
- Each submodule has its own package version; release process is not formalized.

## Release notes
- No release note workflow is documented (TBD).

## Agent expectations
- Coding agents follow `agent.md` and must append entries to each submodule `changes.agent.md` when making changes.
